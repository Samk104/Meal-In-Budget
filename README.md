Motivation
Time: As students, we have a lot of time constraints and often face the issue where we need to cook a quick recipe and prep for the meals well in advance.
Planning: Thinking about what to cook, making a list of my groceries and finding the best deals from our nearest stores , all these steps are often time consuming.
Innovation: We envisioned a tool that would simplify these tasks and enable us to plan our meals in a cost-effective manner.
